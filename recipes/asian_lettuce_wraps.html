    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Asian Lettuce Wraps are a light and refreshing dish that combines the vibrant flavors of Asian cuisine with the crispness of fresh lettuce.
         The filling is made from ground chicken or pork, stir-fried with garlic, ginger, and a medley of vegetables
         like bell peppers, carrots, and water chestnuts, all coated in a savory sauce made from soy sauce, hoisin sauce, and sesame oil. 
         This flavorful mixture is spooned into cool, crisp lettuce leaves, creating a delightful contrast of warm and savory filling with 
         the refreshing crunch of lettuce. Garnished with chopped scallions, cilantro, and a sprinkle of sesame seeds, these wraps are perfect for a 
         healthy appetizer or a light main course that is both satisfying and full of flavor.
